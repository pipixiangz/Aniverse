# what kinds of module we should impl?
1. UI
    * Develop a user-friendly front-end interface where users can search for movies, view recommendatins, and intersect with the website.
2. User Profiles
    * Create user profiles to store user information and historical interactions with movies. This can include user ratings and other relevant data
3. Anime databases
    * build a database or use an existing one to store information about animes. Include details like anime titles, genres, desciptions, cast, release year, and any other relevant attributes.
4. Content-Based Recommendation Engine
    * Implement a content-based recommendation engine that analyzes the attributes of animes and user preferences.
    * Calculate similarity scores between animes and recommend animes similar to those a user has previously liked.
5. User-Based Recommendation Engine:
    * Implement a user-based collaborative filtering recommendation engine
    * Calculate user similarity scores based on their past interactions and ratings.
    * Recommend movies liked by users with similar tastes to the target user.
6. Hybrid Recommendation Algorithm:
    * Develop a module that combines recommendations from both content-based and user-based algorithms. We can use a weighted approach to blend the recommedations from each method.
7. Authentication and User Management:
    * Implement user authentication and management features to handle user accounts, login, registration, and password recovery(wait).
